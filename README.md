This project focuses on identifying customer churn drivers using classification models.
The goal was to understand which customer behaviors predict churn and how a business
could take action to improve retention.

### Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- SQL-style feature engineering
- Power BI for visualization

### Key Outcomes
- Built logistic regression and random forest models (AUC: 0.82)
- Identified high-risk customer segments driving ~60% of churn
- Proposed targeted retention strategies based on behavioral insights
