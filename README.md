# Customer Segmentation & Churn Analysis

This project focuses on identifying customer churn drivers using classification models.
The goal was to understand which customer behaviors predict churn and how a business
could take action to improve retention.

### Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- SQL-style feature engineering
- Power BI for visualization

### Analysis 
- In real datasets - expect lower performance due to noise, but the modeling approach and feature logic would remain the same
- Data is simulated, the signal is cleaner than real production data
- The data generation and target definition are closely aligned

### Key Outcomes
- Built logistic regression and random forest models (AUC: 0.90)
- Identified high-risk customer segments driving ~60% of churn
- Proposed targeted retention strategies based on behavioral insights
- Identified churn drivers and demonstrate an end-to-end modeling workflow
